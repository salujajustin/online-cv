research:
    title: Mixed Coordinate System Dynamic Estimation for Agile 3D Maneuvers
    details: |
        - Derived a hybrid cartesian-spherical tracking algorithm for fast moving aerial targets by Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar
        - Established substantial accuracy improvement compared to previous benchmark studies found in practical 3D target tracking through Monte Carlo simulations
        - Produced 3D animations and GUIs for real time error analysis and visual inspection

    title: A Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm for Heart-rate Detection Using Doppler Motion-Sensing Radar
    details: |
        - Implemented a real time supervised machine learning method to accurately measure heart rate, $<$ 4\% error, even if it is weak or overwhelmed by respiratory movement using non-contact Doppler radar
        - Designed and manufactured custom photoplethysmogram (PPG) \& electrocardiogram (ECG) circuits for ground truth measurement and error analysis
        - Developed a user friendly Python wrapper for the NI-USB DAQ series driver to sample, timestamp, and record multiple analog inputs 
        - Surveyed and compiled a patient database of Doppler radar samples for the scientific community
        - Created Interactive GUIs for real time heart beat analysis using dynamic plotting libraries and the Qt interface

    title: An Optimal Jamming Strategy in a Wireless Ad hoc Network
    details: |
        - Assessed the feasibility of a binary integer linear program (ILP) algorithm to partition a small $\leq$ 50-node mobile network with desired mobility model implementation
        - Coded and matured mobility models (e.g. Random Waypoint, Random Direction, Reference Point Group Mobility Models) for the performance evaluation of jammer placement and network preservation
        - Built and tested autonomous robots under jammed communication environments

    title: Empirical Verification of Theoretical Models on Performance Characteristics of Micro-Pillar Wick Structures 
    details: |
        - Designed and manufactured support structures for passive heat spreaders
        - Analyzed and compared different wick architectures, which was used to design the optimal wick for a given set of conditions
